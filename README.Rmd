The goal of mutils is to provide useful functions to make data processing smoother. Most functions contained here are "nifty", rather than "innovative".

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("MyKo101/mutils")
```

```{r include=F}
#library(mutils)
```

## Overview

Overall, this package is just a collection of functions that I've created as a data scientist. It is far from exhaustive, but it contains many of the functions that I find myself using repeatedly. Some are simple formula, some are designed to make processes quicker and some create tidier outputs (to my personal standards). There may be simpler/faster/more obvious ways to do many of the things contained in here, and improvements on speed/efficiency are more than welcome.
